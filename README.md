### Setup Development Environment
1. Clone the project from https://github.com/olavoparno/git-commits.git
2. Run `npm install` in order to install the project dependencies
3. Run either `npm run build` to literally build the project into `<rootDir>/build` or run `npm start` in order to serve the project in your browser

### External Libs used
1. [React Table](https://github.com/tannerlinsley/react-table)
   - Chosen due to its implementation simplicity
2. [React Select](https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select)
   - Same as React Table
3. [React Debounce Input](https://github.com/nkbt/react-debounce-input)
   - Also chosen due to its ease of use using debounce while already implementing key press events
4. [Typedoc](https://github.com/TypeStrong/typedoc)
   - Used to document the whole project with its JSDoc markups
5. [Changelog](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog/tree/master/packages/conventional-changelog-cli)
   - Adopted in order to keep track of releases and its changes
6. [Jest Badges Readme](https://github.com/olavoparno/jest-badges-readme)
   - Locally track test coverage ratios with readme badges
  
### TODO
* A better state management implementation
* React components unit tests
* TypeDoc declarations throughout the project
* Better componentization definition
* Decentralization of styles either with continued SCSS usage or with styled-components
* Add display functionalities when clicking the commit
